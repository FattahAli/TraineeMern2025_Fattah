## React Cont..

## Formik

 
lightweight React library for building forms with ease.

- Manages **form state**, **validation**, and **submission** logic.
- Reduces boilerplate using helper components like `<Field>` and `<Form>`.
- Integrates smoothly with **Yup** for schema-based validation.
- Keeps form state local to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Zustand
Zustand is a fast, minimalist state management library for React.
- No boilerplateâ€”create a global store using plain JavaScript.
- No context provider needed; use the store anywhere via hooks.
- Efficient: Only re-renders components that use updated state slices.
- Supports async actions and middleware (e.g., devtools, persistence) easily.
