# OOPS in Javascript
- **Encapsulation:**
properties and methods in the same block
no parameters in functions

Let employee = {
baseSalary: 30,000,
overtime:10,
rate:20,
getWage(){
return this.baseSalary+ (this.overtime*this.rate);
	}
};

employee.getWage();

- **Abstraction:**
The working is hidden from the public

- **inheritance:**
Removes redundant code
Child will have same properties as ancestors
