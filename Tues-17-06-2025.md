# HTML:
backbone of web dev
follows tree structure
Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element.
Attribute values containing a space or special characters must be contained within quotes.
With `defer`, HTML rendering is not blocked during the download, and the JavaScript only executes after the document has otherwise finished rendering
The `<cite>` element is used to indicate the source of a quote, not the quote itself.
- Don't include interactive content, such as a `<button>` or `<input>`, inside a link. Don't nest a link within a `<button>` or `<label>` either. While the HTML page will still render, nesting focusable and clickable elements inside interactive elements creates a bad user experience.
Meta data is data about data
Lists
Image/video/audio

# CSS:
Always follow top to bottom approach

block takes complete width of the parent
inline-block takes the space that is required but also allows us to add margins
flex is applied on the parent container
justify-content: horizontal axis
align-items: vertical axis


**Note: on the web the fonts look pixelated so use these two lines in body css**
**-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased ;**

**-moz-osx-font-smoothing:grayscale;**

position relative allows to move anything in any direction

z index is positioning of z axis  + position relative
