## Creating a New Branch

```bash
git branch <new-branch-name>
```
Creates a new branch but does not switch to it.

To create and switch to the new branch in one command:
```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

---

## Switching Between Branches

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```
Switches to the specified branch.

---

## Renaming a Branch

```bash
git branch -m <new-name>
```
Renames the current branch to the new name.

---

## Pushing Changes

```bash
git push
```
Pushes committed changes to the remote repository.

To push a newly created branch and set upstream:
```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

---

## Pulling Changes

```bash
git pull
```
Fetches and integrates updates from the remote repository into your current branch.

---

## Deleting a Branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

To force delete (even if not merged):
```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

---

## Merging a Feature Branch into Main (After Main Has Updated)

If you're working on a feature branch and the `main` branch has been updated, you can merge the feature into `main` using:

```bash
git merge --squash feature-branch
```
This combines all commits from the feature branch into a single commit on the current branch for a cleaner history.

---

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
