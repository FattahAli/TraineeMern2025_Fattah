# CSS (Continued)
position absolute takes the element out of document and allows overflow
margin auto : automatically adds equal margins on sides
using max width only apply to specified width and does not change elements to other sizes
while using media queries if you face min-width issue that might be because of meta line is missing
if you want to add prefix before the class make sure to add "\" like .sm\:
tailwind is mobile first
.class name #id
specificity can be done
rem is according to the parent 
rgb, hash,rgba, hsl can be used
functions can be used
keyframes for animations(have to specify the requirements)
